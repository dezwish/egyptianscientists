                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <span class="grey">born on the 16th of November in 1935 in Bilbeis, El Sharqia, Egypt</span>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Magdi Habib Yacoub</span> was born to a Coptic Christian family, and spent his childhood moving around a number of different small towns. His father was a surgeon, who later worked in public health. He died in 1958.
                    <br>Yacoub later recalled that both his father and the death of his youngest aunt at age 22 years from an uncorrected mitral stenosis during childbirth inspired him to study medicine and cardiology, saying that <span class="grey">“this young woman would not have died if we had had access to facilities which were then available in a few centres around the world”</span>.

            <h2>Youth and Education</h2>
            <p>
                At the age of 15, he entered the <span class="bold">University of Cairo College of Medicine</span> with a scholarship.<br>
                In 1957, Yacoub graduated in medicine from Cairo University and completed two years of residencies in surgery.<br>
                In 1961 or 1962 he moved to Britain to study for his fellowship while working under Sir Russell Brock, consultant surgeon at Guy's Hospital.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Heart Valve Operation</h2>
            <p>In 1964, he was appointed rotating surgical senior registrar to the National Heart and Chest Hospitals, where he worked with cardiothoracic surgeon Donald Ross.<br><br>
                Here, they worked on repairing heart valves in people with severe valvular heart disease and heart failure. Four of their cases, operated on between December 1965 and October 1967, were reported on in the British Medical Journal (1968) in an article titled <span class="grey">"Too ill for cardiac surgery?"</span>.<br><br>
                Three had severe aortic valve disease and one had rheumatic heart disease with multiple affected valves. All four had a poor prognosis with death expected within a few days and all four survived surgery.<br><br>
                He carried out a number of Ross procedures, where the diseased aortic valve is replaced with the person's own pulmonary valve, particularly in growing children.It became a popular alternative to the surgical treatment of aortic valve disease in young adults and avoided the need for anticoagulation and repeated operations. Yacoub modified the operation by planning remodelling of the autograft root, the Ross-Yacoub procedure,performed in carefully selected people. At a time when cardiologists may have been reluctant to refer for surgery, Yacoub's search for operable people earned him the name <span class="grey">"Magdi's midnight stars"</span>.
